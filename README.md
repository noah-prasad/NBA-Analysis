## General Information
This project was completed in order to utilize skills used in a Data Wrangling course at the University of Iowa. My groupmates and I used R in order to analyze individual player and team statistics for the NBA so that we could identify statistics that were significant in determining team success.


## Technologies Used
- R
- Rstudio


## Features
- Dataframes containing the top players in given statistics
- Data Visualizations showing the relationship between team statistics and win percentage
- Dataframes containing all team data for every team in the NBA


## Setup
The only dependecies necessary are the packages used in the files. In order to download these packages a user would simply use the install.packages() function with the specified package in Rstudio.

## Usage
In order to use this project one would simply clone down this repository, open both the .R file and the .rdata file in Rstudio and run any code past the comment denoting hypothesis testing. This would allow the user to see our analysis and this visualizations that we made. The user could also modify the code or add onto it to run additional tests on our dataframes.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement
The main area for improvement is that our project was originally intended to be predictive but ended up being more of a deep dive into which statistics were significant in determining team success. In the future I would like to find a way to make a more predictive model that could predict a teams win percentage based on other attributes of the team.

## Acknowledgements
This project was assigned to my team and I by Mike Colbert. I worked alongside Owen Koury, Delaney Collis and Victoria Markuson in order to complete this project.
